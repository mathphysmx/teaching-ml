# Introduction

Numbered comments below are only for the questions that were somehow incorrect. In general there was a good improvement in your knowledge regarding ML, so Congrats!

# Felipe

2. Missing
4. Print the string not its *type*.
5. *Index* column is not correct.
7. Random Forests, SVM models missing.

# Moises

2. Verify $\varepsilon$
4. Print the string not its *type*.
7. SVM model missing.

# Reynaldo

2. The model is $y = 2x + 1$ instead of $y = \theta x$. Intersection with the $y$ axis is missing in your model. Numeric value of the error is missing.
4-7. missing.

# David

2. Verify $\varepsilon$ formula. y_true <->  y_pred .
5. Answer OK. `Ml_classification = ["Unsupervised learning"]+["Supervised learning"]` con be simplified by `Ml_classification = ["Unsupervised learning", "Supervised learning"]`
7d-7f missing.

# Karla

2. MSE missing
5. *Index* column is not correct.
7. Best model must be found using only the training dataset. Therefore, `train_test_split` must be used before any model training. The best model is not Decision Trees.
